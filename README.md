# phails

Phails is a suite of ruby/bash utils that will help you manage your dev environment as if it were Rails.  The need comes from working in a PHP/Codeigniter codebase with phpUnit, and no framework for migrations.

Mostly, it's a set of ruby and bash scripts that help you to:

1. Setup your dev environment with the help of Homebrew and Brewdler
2. Configure Apache and PHP (MAMP is the worst)
3. configure your mysql database
4. Manage database versioning (keeping track of schema and migrations in a structure.sql file, ala rails)
5. Run tests easily, and get useful debugging/stacktrace information instead of letting PHPUnit just die.
6. Lint your entire app quickly so you can check for sytax errors when things go pear-shaped.
7. Save the world?
